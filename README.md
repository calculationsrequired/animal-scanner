### Abstract
Using convolution neural network, the goal of this project will be to take in an image of an everyday object, identify  the object, and retrieve historical or interesting data to the user. 
### Data Set
This project will use the Microsfot Common Objects in Context (COCO), which contains images and their labels and classifications. 
### Software
Tensorflow and Keras with Python. 
### Relevant Research Articles
ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Alex Krizhevsky
### Collaboration
This will be a one-person project. 
### Project Milestones
November 6 - Object scanner is able to identify an object picture against a white or constrasting background.
